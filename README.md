# Splart: Differentiable Painting

Splart is an alternative approach to the ideas of Drarwing.
Instead of the genetic algorithm drarwing uses, 
splart uses differential rendering and backpropagation to generate images.

This approach is inspired by 3D gaussian splatting, 
but in a 2D setting. So 2D gaussian splatting. But it also trades gaussian splats for textures. 
So 2D texture compositing. But that sounds like normal rasterization, while we use differentiable rendering....
Let's call it differentiable painting!


# WIP!
Almost done! Just need to update some minor stuff and write the corresponding blogpost. 

### Todos:
   
- Also store the non-optimized GIF! -> properly clean up the code, update readme above
- make a nice gallery!!!
- update blogpost also with streamlit and normal map
